- **New Passives:** Pyromaniac - Fire attacks heal you and grow stronger over time.
- **New Mutations:** 
  - Magma Eyes: Fire-element basic attacks and burn on hit.

  - Ember Blade: A blade forged in flame. Burns foes on contact.

## Installation
The mod files are set up to use `.append` and `.patch` files so they do not conflict with the base game files or other mods! They will safely merge into the global item and mutation pools upon loading.
